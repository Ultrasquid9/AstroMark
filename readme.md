# AstroMark
### A simple yet powerful tool for editing Markdown

AstroMark is a simple yet powerful tool for editing Markdown files. It is written in Rust and uses the Libcosmic UI framework, allowing it to have speeds that exceed similar graphical markdown editors available. 

AstroMark's most unique feature is its ability to be configured via the Rhai scripting language. Using a scripting language for configuration allows for far greater customizability than a Json or Toml settings file can, and is what makes AstroMark so much more powerful than other Markdown editors out there. 

Note: AstroMark is currently WIP.
